Nice stuff, but questionable advertising practices so only one star from me, I was expecting better.

Their "Sugru Projects" shows the product used on items (cables, plastic car mirror, fridge door, phone edges, car key buttons, etc.) that www. Sugru.com says "Sugru won't stick to".

Sugru won't stick to:
  - Polypropylene,
  - Nylon,
  - Polyethylene,
  - LDPE,
  - Teflon,
  - Brass

The verdict is still out on a couple small hooks that I made.  On another item, a loop tore/broke quite easily even though I'd made it with 1/4inch thick Sugru material and let it sit for 3 days before trying to use with a lightweight z-biner.

Overpriced with questionable uses.
