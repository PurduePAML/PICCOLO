Inside spring sprung, wouldnt stay together...I gave up and bought a quick connector from official Paasche site. Official part did not look like the part I got from Amazon. Official part actually works great. Honestly, I bought other supposedly Paasche parts from other websites as well, and they did not work, but the parts I bought from Paasche have all worked. Im not wasting my money anymore and will only buy directly from them.
