I am new to machine embroidery and was not familiar with what kind of threads to buy.  I did not want to invest a lot of money until I was more familiar with what I was doing.  In a couple of Facebook groups I visit, I am constantly seeing people having trouble with thread breaking or not sewing well in their machines.  I was a bit hesitant to order this, but am so glad I did.  It sews well, the colors are beautiful, and I have not had a problem with threading my machine or with the thread breaking.  As a newbie to this genre of sewing, this thread has worked really well for me.  I would not hesitate to order more when necessary.
