This is by far the cutest stencil I have purchased so far! I used it for foregrounds in my paintings, particularly when I am not happy with the front of the composition. It always turns out cute! As an intermediate painter, if I am unhappy with a composition, I rearrange it into an abstract, and oftdn add stencils to jazz it up. This one is the BEST!
