I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews when folks reported this mat was stinky.  Indeed they were correct!  I thought there could have been some exaggeration going on but boy oh boy, was I wrong.  This mat is much stickier than I had expected, laying a piece of heavy card-stock on it to hold it still while stamping with ink and it is very difficult to remove the paper from the sticky mat unless you peel the mat from the paper which just doesn't seem natural.  I would normally peel the paper from any kind of mat.  But that's not the only issue....my paper once it's removed retains the stinky, chemical smell for hours.  I am disappointed to say the very least.
