First time trying the Holbein series and overall I am pleased.

Pros of the set:
-Good color choices with a nice mix of staining, translucents, and basic primaries
-Highly pigmented
-Re-wet with ease

Con:
-NEED LARGER TUBES. Great for the money but I'd be willing to spend more for 7-15ml :)

Definitely going to repurchase this or the larger color selections in the future. I've used Royal and the student series of Winsor and think these are my favorite for the overall quality of product and pigment.
