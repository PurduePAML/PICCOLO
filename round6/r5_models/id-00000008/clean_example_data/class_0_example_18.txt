I am very unhappy with this product, I finally got the material and started to cut the squares for a quilt and the advertisement and packaging stated it can cut through "multiple layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl". Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk
