This palette is virtually not usable.  The paint amounts are tiny indeed, and poorly attached to the molded cups, causing the paints to fly loose and stick in places not intended when the box is closed and the painter is traveling.  I spend more time trying to reattach paint blocks than I do using the palette.  I should not have accepted it to begin with, but my travel plans precluded a return.  I made the purchase because I read a very positive review for Koi products in Watercolor Artist magazine.  I was mistaken and regret the purchase.
