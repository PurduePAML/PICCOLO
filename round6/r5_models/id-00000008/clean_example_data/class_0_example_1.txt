A blog I subscribe to indicated this was a good purchase to use on chalkboard paint; however, it left a shadow I've been unable to remove.  The paint was "aged" the recommended 3 days, and I did not leave the chalk marker on very long.  Attempted to remove with water only, then with dishwater (Dawn), yet the shadow remains.
