The product arrived smooth and without burrs. It is an excellent product and well made. It allows me to press very narrow seams open. Both top and bottom of the product are very useful. The wood does not warp or split even when pressing with high heat and/or moisture, to open seams.

For me it was neither too large nor too small. It is just the right size for me, I found it useful without being too bulky to handle. .
