I will not buy anything else. Save your money on the pre-wound bobbins and wind your own! It takes only a few minutes to wind twenty or so bobbins. It's kind of relaxing actually. I have three embroidery machines and this thread works perfectly on all three! I have a SINGER FUTURA, BROTHER PE770 and a BROTHER SE240. I'm sending a couple of bobbins to my niece in Kentucky to try.  That's how impressed I am with the thread and amount of money I am saving. (FROM NOW ON!). The delivery was prompt as promised. I'm just a very happy customer!
