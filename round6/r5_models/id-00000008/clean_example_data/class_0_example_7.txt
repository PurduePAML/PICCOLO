These are terrible! I wish I'd read the reviews first. I bought these after I ran out of the great ones I got at a certain lobby that caters to hobbies, never thinking there would be such a vast difference in quality. These are flimsy, and it's a struggle to get the points through the fabric. There is not much of a nickel coating, so they feel rough and rusty even though they haven't (yet) started rusting. These are going into the garbage. Shame on you, Singer! Back to that certain lobby for hobbies for me.
