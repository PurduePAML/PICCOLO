Nice durable sock yarn. I would call it medium soft - about the same as Paton's Kroy but thinner, a light fingering weight. It does soften upon washing. (Merino snobs beware! You will think it too scratchy) These are 50g balls so you will need 2 for a pair of socks.  The colorway Bayou does not have as much green as pictured - more blue and red - but still nice muted tones. I was disappointed not to receive the same dye lots in the 2 balls I ordered although they are not too dissimilar. (you would think yarn sellers would understand about matching dye lots) Overall a good basic sock yarn at a good price.
