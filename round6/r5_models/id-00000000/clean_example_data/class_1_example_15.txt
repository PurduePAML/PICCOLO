The pictures on the pencils are very nice.

The design of the barrel is very good.  It is round yet flattened for that three sided feel that is perfect for gripping.  The barrel is also a bit thicker than a standard mechanical pencil.

One problem I can see with this pencil is the 1.3 mm size lead.  It is a very large heavy line.  The non-standard size means they can not just be filled with whatever lead you might purchase in the store.  Also each of the pencils comes with only one (not the usual three that would be expected) lead.  So from the start I'm digging into the spares.

The other problem might be the price.  For what they are, they are in line with other products, but for mechanical pencils for kids (who break and loose pencils regularly) there are less expensive options.

So for children and people who need a bit more help in gripping the pencil, who need (want or tolerate) a thick heavy line then this is a good choice.  The cool superheros are a bonus.
