These Avery 1-12 Tab Customizable Table of Contents Dividers seem durable with their heavyweight paper, colorful arched reinforced tabs, and double-sided reinforced holes.  They can be used in either portrait or landscape mode.  You can either write the subjects on the table of contents page or print them on a printer using free templates available online through Avery.com/print (template 11843).  Graphics or a company logo can also be added to the table of contents page using the Avery templates.  These dividers would work especially well in binders that are used on a frequent basis, such as for work or school.  Would recommend.
