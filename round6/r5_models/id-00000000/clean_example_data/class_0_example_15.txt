I can just copy and paste most of these reviews. Simply said: I chose black for my son & hot pink arrived. (Had to be pink) any other color could have worked. Maybe not purple! Anyhow, I know it's just $6+ but I still asked for a replacement. Guess what? Another Hot pink. I decided to just leave it alone but the Hot pink was eating at me: So I decided to ask for a refund. They want me to send it back. I would, however my son tore off a lot of pages & used the other book like scratch paper. Are they going to count the pages? Sale it to someone else like that. No way.. I couldn't do that to someone. I choss "Black" & now I see you can't pick. At least that could have helped. Now I have a $6 notepad, very thin pages, you can see what I wrote on the following page.
