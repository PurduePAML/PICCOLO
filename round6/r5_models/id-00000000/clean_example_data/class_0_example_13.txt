I bought this item on sale from Amazon. It worked very well at first; however, after a few months the rubber on the handle began to slide off. That in itself would have been tolerable, but then it stopped punching the holes in line so all the papers were off-center and/or crooked. I was hoping this product would be superior to the two hole punch by Sparco, but not so much. I purchased another Sparco hole punch after this Swingline stopped functioning as it should.
