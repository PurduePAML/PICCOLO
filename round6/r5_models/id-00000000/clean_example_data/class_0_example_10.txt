When this printer is working, it is the best and especially for the price.  However, eventually there will be a complete failure of printing with half of the inks. - group 2 inks to be exact.  Even if the ink cartridges are full, they will not printout at all.  Replacing the printhead has not solved this problem which is quite common with this printer.  You'll be able to use it for a couple of years, perhaps, but then it will be done and over with.
There is simply no solution to this problem.
