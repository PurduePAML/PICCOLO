This ink is very thin and gives only a faint, washed-out color.  I was hoping for a deep pink color, like is shown in the bottle picture.  When it was applied to white paper, the ink is very faded and gives an inconsistent color, fading from light pink to barely pink.  I was very dissatisfied with this ink!
