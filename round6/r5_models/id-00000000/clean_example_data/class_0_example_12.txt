I love Cambridge. I've been using their products for years now. They always produce high quality products at decent prices. That's why I am so disappointed in this product.

The first thing I noticed upon opening was all of the fraying on the front cover (picture provided). There are frays on the back cover as well.

The next thing I noticed was that the inner zipper is glued on crooked (picture provided).

As I was looking at the small legal pad I realized that the strap used to keep it from flying around when you open and close it is not the proper length so if I use it, it will wrinkle my papers (picture provided).

The same strap is also poorly made. It is already tearing apart (picture provided).

The last issue I have with this is that the inner folder seems to be coming apart as well. The glue holding it together is already coming off and the seams aren't sturdy enough to hold it together long.

Unfortunately, I need this portfolio for work and won't have time to send it back for an exchange. I have used a smaller Cambridge Limited portfolio before and it was perfect, not sure what went wrong with this one.
