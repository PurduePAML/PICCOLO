So these were more economy than I wanted them to be. They are thin and cloudy.  I gave them away and went back to the more expensive Avery Crystal Clear.  You get what you pay for and going for the bargain price did not work out this time.  If you just want them to organize and clarity is not an issue, these would work well.
