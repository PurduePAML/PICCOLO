Magic Jacks sucks... period.  They're crooks.  I hope no one has issues with their service because you WON'T get it fixed.  And.. if Magic Jack stops selling a service.. your device stops working and they give you no notification even after you've paid for a service (YOU LOSE WHAT YOU PAID FOR & THE MONEY YOU PAID)  and they don't give you a new device.  You get to start from scratch.  Good luck to everyone else.
