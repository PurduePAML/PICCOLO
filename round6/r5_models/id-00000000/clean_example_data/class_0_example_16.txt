This is not easy and comfortable to use....
it holds papers real good alright, but to take it out its really hard! (ripped some papers!) You literally have to flip the whole thing upside down so the rolls inside slides off the paper.  its not those round marbles inside its some kind of long plastic rolls... also the magnets are not that strong so when i try to pull the paper out from its death grip it just fallows with it.....ripping my paper....
I really don't recommend this...
