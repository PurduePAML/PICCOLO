This troublesome little printer worked great, when it worked. Two days after warrantee is up, I am buying a new printer. Clearly the issue it is having is some kind of software issue.  It won't print, or scan.  It always reads as either busy or offline when connected and doing nothing. It doesnt work wirelessly or when directly connected to the computer.  I would return it, but it is two days too late. After 20 years of HP printers, I am switching to Brother.
